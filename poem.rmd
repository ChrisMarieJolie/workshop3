## Last Verse
I note the obvious differences  
in the human family.  
Some of us are serious,  
some thrive on comedy.  

Some declare their lives are lived  
as true profundity,  
and others claim they really live  
the real reality.  

The variety of our skin tones  
can confuse, bemuse, delight,  
brown and pink and beige and purple,  
tan and blue and white.  

I've sailed upon the seven seas  
and stopped in every land,  
I've seen the wonders of the world  
not yet one common man.  

I know ten thousand women  
called Jane and Mary Jane,  
but I've not seen any two  
who really were the same.
